# Topology-Layer-Creation.
For creation automatic topology layer creation using 3 defined rules(Must not overlap, Must Not Have Pseudo-Nodes, Must Not Have Dangles) a code has been developed for geospatial data.
One gdb which contains point, line and polygon features.But i need only topology layer creation for line features and there has huge number of feature class.Then this code will help you. Automatically it will filter line features and create topology layer within one dataset as per source feature class name.

Directions:
You have to give a gdb file location as source gdb.
You have to give new gdb file name.
You have to give a name of dataset.
You have to give a output file location.
